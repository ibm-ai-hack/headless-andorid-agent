# BuckeyeBot — Use Cases & Implemented Functionality

## Overview

BuckeyeBot is a unified AI assistant for Ohio State University students, accessible entirely via SMS. It consolidates campus services, academic tools, food ordering, and real-time campus data into a single text-based interface. The system is built on the BeeAI Framework with IBM Granite as the LLM backbone, running 56 agent tools across 6 domains.

---

## Architecture Summary

| Component | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** | BeeAI `RequirementAgent` + IBM Granite 3 8B | Orchestrates all tool calls and generates SMS-friendly responses |
| **SMS Gateway** | Flask + Twilio webhook | Receives/sends texts; handles message chunking for SMS limits |
| **Campus APIs** | `httpx` async client → OSU content APIs | Real-time campus data (dining, buses, parking, events, etc.) |
| **Canvas (Carmen)** | `canvasapi` Python SDK | Course info, assignments, grades, announcements |
| **Grubhub** | Appium + Android emulator | Automated food ordering via UI automation |
| **BuckeyeLink** | Playwright browser automation | Class schedule, grades, financial aid, enrollment |
| **BuckeyeLink Web UI** | FastAPI + WebSocket + browser-use agent | Separate interactive web app for SSO-authenticated schedule extraction |

---

## SMS Interface

**How it works:** A student texts the Twilio phone number. The Flask server receives the webhook, passes the message to the BeeAI agent, and returns the response as TwiML.

**Implemented features:**
- Incoming SMS webhook at `/sms` (POST)
- Automatic message chunking for SMS length limits (splits at 1500 chars on newline/space boundaries)
- XML-safe TwiML response generation with proper escaping
- Outbound SMS via Twilio REST API (for proactive messages)
- Error handling with user-friendly fallback messages
